    You are given an image of a bill or invoice. Extract all the product entries and any additional transaction details from it.

Output Format Instructions:
1. Return a single valid JSON array (i.e., response must start with '[' and end with ']').
2. Each product should be represented as one JSON object inside this list. The keys should be the column headers (e.g., "QTY", "DESCRIPTION", "UNIT PRICE", "DISCOUNT (%)", "TOTAL").
3. Each row in the table corresponds to one JSON object. Do not duplicate or infer rows that do not exist in the image.
4. All values must be strings enclosed in double quotes — even for numeric or currency values (e.g., "00001", "$100", "10").
5. Preserve all prefixes, postfixes, and symbols exactly as they appear (do not modify "$", "%", commas, etc.).
6. After all product JSONs, add exactly one final JSON object containing other invoice-related details (like buyer name, transaction ID, total amount, date, etc.).  
   - This JSON should only include non-empty, meaningful key-value pairs.  
   - If there are no such details, include an empty JSON `{}` as the last element.
7. The entire output must be a single JSON list — no explanations, extra text, or formatting outside the list.

Example structure (not actual values):
[
  {
    "QTY": "2",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Modern Ergonomic Office Chair",
